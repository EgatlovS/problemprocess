Just played around with some exclusive gateways and enums in user-tasks!

## Exclusive Gateway
> An exclusive gateway means exactly one outgoing sequenceflow.
> A converging exclusive gateway means that it doesnt wait for a second token.
> So at the point a token arrives at the gateway it will be send to the outgoing sequence
> flow even if theres for some reason another one out there reaching the gateway in some time.

## Enum
> Theres one thing to say about the enum:
> If you want to reference a chosen value from the enum in another usertask just use
> a string to represent it. I saw a lot of projects do it like this.
